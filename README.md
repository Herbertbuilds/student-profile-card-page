### **Student Profile Card Page** 

in a class activity we were tasked to create **Student Profile Card Page**! This is a simple, yet stylish web project I built the site with purple color palete and used grids for the layout of the cards. We were tasked to display information using just **HTML** and **CSS**. I tried making it responsive, so it responsive on all devices.

Whether you're a fellow student, a developer, or just curious about web design, we hope you find this project useful.

### **What's Inside?** 

This project is built with two main files:

* `index.html`: The core of the project. This is where you'll find the structure for each student's profile card.
* `style.css`: This file contains all the styling for the layout, the card aesthetics, and the cool hover effects that bring the page to life.

### **Features** 

We've packed this project with some great features:

* **A beautiful grid layout**: The profiles are arranged in a clean, responsive grid that automatically adjusts to fit different screen sizes.
* **Modern card design**: Each card is sleek and modern, with a simple hover effect that makes it feel interactive and polished.
* **Essential student details**: Every card includes a photo, name, course, and a unique "fun fact" to add a personal touch.
* **Fully responsive**: The page looks fantastic on desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

### **Wanna Customize It?** 

This project is designed to be easy to customize. Here's how:

* **Add or edit student profiles**: Simply open the `index.html` file and look for the `<article class="profile-card">` sections. You can duplicate them to add a new student or edit the existing ones.
* **Change the look**: Feel free to play around with the styles in `style.css` to change colors, fonts, and more.
